[08/26/2023 17:09] plamkata
@Yos | Chainlink or anybody really, why in the ``StakingPoolBase`` contract, whenever we access the value of ``stakerPrincipal`` from the history, sometimes it is casted to uint256 and sometimes to uint112?


[08/26/2023 17:12] yosriady
No reason in particular, sometimes calculations are simpler when it is cast in a particular way. For context, the entirety of LINK supply can fit in uint96.


[08/26/2023 17:17] yosriady
The reason why principal is using uint112 instead of uint256 is so it can fit in a single Checkpoint.Trace224 alongside averageStakedAtTime

Since I am not extremely familiar with the Checkpoints, is the history shifted to the right since the first 32 bits of the Checkpoint struct are the key and the last 224 bits are the actual stored value?

From the documentation

```In addition to this, the
contract manager can also call withdrawUnvestedReward to withdraw any non-emitted LINK
from the vault.```

However, I cannot find withdrawUnvestedReward from the code

Any idea on this? Thanks


[08/27/2023 09:28] plamkata
How much is a juel, an thus juel/second?


[08/27/2023 09:38] 0xlemon
A juel is the equivalent of wei. In the context of LINK tokens(1 LINK token = 10^18 jules)


[08/27/2023 10:11] aga7hokakological
nope. I told by 3gle I tried on fresh repo. git submodules etc got installed I thought it worked but then gave the same error. If anyone has solution plz tell


[08/27/2023 14:05] liffidmonky
@Yos | Chainlink @Hendrik | Chainlink  @Lia | Chainlink  @Dimitri | Chainlink I think there is an error in the docs regarding to the migration feature:

On actions.pdf in the docs folder says:

- Staking v0.1 calls onTokenTransfer in the `RewardVault` contract.
- The MigrationProxy contract determines if the sender is a Node Operator Staker or
Community Staker and routes the migrated LINK to either the NOPStakingPool or
CommunityStakingPool. Any unmigrated LINK tokens are transferred back to the
staker.

But on specs.pdf in the migration section they dont mention any interaction Stakingv0.1 - RewardVault.
They mention direct interaction Stakingv0.1 - MigrationProxy. Code seems to be actually doing what is said
in specs.pdf.

Is this correct and the line:
`- Staking v0.1 calls onTokenTransfer in the `RewardVault` contract.`
should be changed to:
`- Staking v0.1 calls onTokenTransfer in the `MigrationProxy` contract.` ???


[08/27/2023 14:11] yosriady
Good catch, the withdrawUnvestedReward() function has been removed and the logic has been moved into the RewardVault.close() function

[08/27/2023 14:13] yosriady

[08/27/2023 16:29] limbooo9
I'm curious why operators are not allowed to stake in the community pool if they have been removed, even though they would be allowed in newer versions, I think.


[08/27/2023 17:09] liffidmonky
@Yos | Chainlink @Hendrik | Chainlink  @Lia | Chainlink  @Dimitri | Chainlink Question about the note:

`NOTE: This documentation and code contains parameter config values. These config values
are for illustration purposes only in order to explain how the code executes through examples.
Such configs will be set at different values upon launch.`

In the note, it's mentioned that the code has illustrative config values. For contracts like MigratorProxy, 
which depend on other contracts being deployed already, does this mean the addresses of these already deployed contracts (like the staking pools for example)
will be hardcoded into the source code? Or will they be provided as constructor arguments during deployment?


[08/27/2023 17:11] yosriady
Contract addresses are provided as constructor arguments instead of being hardcoded for better extensibility and modularity.


[08/27/2023 17:12] yosriady
We'll come back to you on this. For context, removing a misbehaving operator from the network is a rare scenario.

@Yos | Chainlink Qs about v01 unstake functionality. When the migration is open, v01.unstake(), will be instantaneous or it will lock the stake for a certain period, and then users will be able to claim it?


[08/28/2023 18:31] yosriady
In v0.1, unstake() is instantaneous (once the migration phase is open.) 
In v0.2, unstake() is not instantaneous; it goes through an unbonding period.

The way to stake in the stakingpool is send link token directly right? OnTransfer function take care stake the link?


[08/29/2023 22:22] cll_dev_economics#0018
To stake, you would call the `transferAndCall` call function on the LINK token and specify the recipient as the address of the staking pool.

@Yos | Chainlink @Hendrik | Chainlink  in the timelock contract event CallExecuted, what does this mean?:    * @dev The target is not indexed in order to keep the original event signature
As far as I know event signatures dont depend on indexed argument but the name of the event and the type of the arguments.

@Yos | Chainlink DM sent


[08/30/2023 10:07] yosriady
Good catch. The general intent here to minimize the amount of changes from the OZ Timelock contract. I think changing it will still change the topics and data section of the event, even if the signature remains the same.

{Reactions}
✅ 

[08/30/2023 10:27] liffidmonky
So you wanna stick to the names of the OZ contract, thats why `updateDelay(uint256 newDelay)` is called like that and not something like `updateMinDelay()`. Idk I find  the second name more appropiate for the function. What you think?


[08/30/2023 10:28] yosriady
I think it's better to retain the signatures of existing functions.

Hey everyone. I am Aamir. I am Trying an audit first time on code4rena. I am not sure about some rules. Can someone tell me if we are not sure the category of the vulnerability would it be counted if we submit it with wrong category. I mean would it be changed during the judging period.

where is the function that you stake tokens in the pool? Is it in the staking-v0.1?


[08/31/2023 09:26] eme0242
You transfer Link tokens directly to Staking pool via transferAndCall, then onTokenReceived function gets called to update stake balance

@Yos | Chainlink will the deployment look something like this?:

1- deployer deploys the contracts in right order
2- Now deployer initiates process of giving StakingTimelock the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` on the contracts
3- Timelock, after delay time, accepts the role

Hi folks, just want to point out that this part of the doc is stale. The actual logic is to slash up to the slashers remaining capacity, not revert.

Guys, hope it will be helpful in setup & running scripts as I see many of people can't run it. Basically before running scripts you must setup Foundry(https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation), after installation reboot your terminal and run `foundry` command in the directory of chainlink. Later you will be available to run any scripts. Example `forge build`(forge part of foundry tool installation).

By the way, it's my first auditing😅
Good luck to everyone🙌

  }
```

See https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-chainlink/blob/main/src/rewards/RewardVault.sol#L1697-L1706

Why would when the vault is closed, then isRemoved operator is considered an operator?

If anyone is having the `Killed` or the generic `Solc Error`  while trying to run the tests you can try the following:

*Disclaimer: This is what worked for me and what I found after a couple hours of research. This doesn't mean it will work for you nor that this is the correct way of fixing the aforementioned errors*

- Make sure you have the latest rustup version installed by running `rustup -v` 
- If you don't have rustup you can get it here:  https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install .
*Rustup is the rust toolchain installer, it is needed to install and manage the Solidity Version Manager (svm)*
- Remove the current `~/.svm` folder  with `rm -rf ~/.svm` ( Only if you have one, in my case I didn't have any svm folder in the system, you can run it anyways to make sure lol)
- Clean install of SVM with `cargo install svm-rs`  SVM is used by foundry to manage compiler versions *(Official Foundry documentation: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/README.md#features)*
- Restart the terminal
- Run `foundryup` to install/update foundry

*Some people on GitHub and Foundry telegram say this should be enough, however I did a couple things before running `forge build` again*

- Clone a clean copy of the repo
- Run `forge clean`
- Run `forge build`

If it compiled succesfully you should be able to run `forge test` without issues 🙂

The docs represent the dev assumptions so anything contradictory in the contracts can be reported as an issue based on the impact. There might be a few typos in the docs  (which have been mentioned above in this group channel) so be sure to check them.

@Yos | Chainlink @Dimitri | Chainlink @Lia | Chainlink @Hendrik | Chainlink In the staking pools base, the `function migrate(bytes calldata data)` function. As I understand it for the v0.1 if data was empty it meant full migration, otherwise a partial one with proportions indicated in `data` parameter. Now in v0.2 the migrate() function plans to function the same way or is it undetermined due to lack of solid knowledge on how v0.3 might look?

`vestedRewardPerToken - rewardPerToken` is calculating the amount of rewards each staked LINK should receive.  We then calculate the Staker’s earned reward by multiplying that by the amount of LINK that staker has staked.  

`vestedRewardPerToken` - The amount of rewards earned per staked LINK since the beginning of the staking program

`rewardPerToken` - The amount of rewards per staked LINK a staker has already earned OR the amount of rewards per staked LINK a staker has missed.  A staker should miss any staking rewards earned prior to them staking.  For example a staker that stakes at T=10 should miss rewards earned from T=0 to T=10.

1. It's to calculate the proportion of rewards to forfeit.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-chainlink/blob/main/src/rewards/RewardVault.sol#L938.  For example a staker unstaking 50% of their principal should result in them forfeiting 50% of their unclaimed rewards.

2. The `operatorPoolCheckpointId` and `communityPoolCheckpointId`s represent the next `checkpointId` to use when a staker stakes. This means that the last `checkpointId` that was used to record a staker's history is at `checkpointId - 1`.

Hey so far there are 2 parts of the docs that are stale right?
1. The removed operator cannot stake in community pool.
2. And that was related to slash capacity.

Hey what is this `predecessor` id in this function:
```Javascript
  function hashOperationBatch(
    Call[] calldata calls,
    bytes32 predecessor,
    bytes32 salt
  ) public pure virtual returns (bytes32) {
    return keccak256(abi.encode(calls, predecessor, salt));
  }
```


[09/06/2023 17:28] aamirusmani1552
The contracts says `   * @param predecessor ID of the preceding operation.`


[09/06/2023 17:29] aamirusmani1552
Why it is important


[09/06/2023 20:48] osmanozdemir1
Every operation batch is tied to the previous batch. Like a blockchain but an opChain maybe 😄

Batch ids are actually some kind of hash that also includes previous batch’s id. 

When an executor tries to execute a batch, previous batch had to be executed already. Otherwise it will revert during “_beforeCall” check.

@Hendrik | Chainlink @Dimitri | Chainlink 

In RewardVault.sol there is following NatSpec: 
`the reclaimable reward is the forfeited reward that can be claimed by the last staker due to empty pools`

Could you elaborate on what exactly is meant by "empty pools"?


[09/07/2023 09:52] cl_dim_21#1974
A pool with no staked LINK


[09/07/2023 09:53] 14si2o_flint
Ok so a pool before it is opened or a closed pool where all the link has been unstaked, correct?


[09/07/2023 09:54] cl_dim_21#1974
Yes though in theory a pool can also be empty before it’s closed as stakers can unstake at any time.

By sending link to the pool and calling the "onTokenTransfer()". 

This is done via the link token's transferAndCall()

[09/09/2023 14:46] 0xsorrynotsorry
Forfeited Rewards
If a staker unstakes before their ramp-up multiplier reaches 1, the staker will forfeit some of their
earned rewards depending on their current multiplier and the amount they unstake relative to
their current staked LINK.

hi5 

[09/09/2023 14:57] 0xumarkhatab
Also according to these lines , what is meant by `will become available for others to claim` 

are they free to claim or they can claim based on their staking ?

```
If a staker completes a withdrawal of any amount of their staked LINK, their ramp-up period will reset to 0% and any Locked Rewards earned will be forfeited back to the rewards pool and become available for all stakers in the same category (i.e., a Community Staker’s Forfeited Rewards can then be earned by all Community Stakers). After a withdrawal of staked LINK, a staker will need to go through the full ramp-up period again in order for Attributed Rewards to fully turn into Claimable Rewards. 

Note that Claimable Rewards can be withdrawn at any point in time by a staker without resetting their ramp-up period progress.

```


[09/09/2023 15:16] devabdee
Means that forfieted rewards will be added back to the rewards pool and will be available for all the stakers just like other rewards (claim based on staking)

Its mean x = (x-y) , y = multiplierDuration .  Function divWadDown returns ( x * Wad) / y.

Hi folks, just calling out that the Staking v0.2 `Timelock`  `ADMIN_ROLE` will be assigned to `address(this)`  the Timelock itself, as is stated in the constructor comments https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-chainlink/blob/main/src/timelock/Timelock.sol#L22.

[09/11/2023 11:42] yosriady
I also want to call out the 2 stale points in the doc about **removed operators**, for visibility. The bullet points below are stale:
```
What can a removed operator do?:
- The Operator’s staked LINK can still be slashed.
- Stake as a Community Staker but with their multiplier reset
```
As is implemented in the code:
- Removed operators can't be slashed https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-chainlink/blob/e0cfce3073a3c9443eac55a377ff74f22e23c163/src/pools/OperatorStakingPool.sol#L271-L273
- Removed operators cannot stake in the CS pool

Thank you for understanding.

Probably not the Timelock, as usually the pause of a protocol is an emergency and should not be delayed.

As folks have pointed out, the pauser role will not be held by the Timelock to allow for a rapid response to emergencies. It won't be held by an EOA either, most likely a Gnosis Safe.

Hey! Regarding Chainlink Staking contest, I got a finding I would like to discuss with the community, can I make it public? I guess as the competition was public and the code too I can safely just share it on linkedin or the discord chat. Am i right or I cant publish it till findings are reviewed? My intention is to get feedback on the validity of a mathematical development I made in the last moments before closing the contest


[09/14/2023 12:30] olanre_waju
Don't do that!!!! Till findings are made public. Also, this is yet to be validated.

Correct. You only need to be certified if the audit requires it. You can find this requirement on the main audit card [here](https://code4rena.com/contests/2023-08-chainlink-staking-v02#top) in the details tab.

You can definitely share your award info -- that's public via the leaderboard anyway. 🙂  

It's anything to do with the *content of the findings* that's confidential.
